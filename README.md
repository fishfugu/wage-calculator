# Wage Calculator

## Introduction

This repo hosts a simple HTML wage calculator designed to assist staff in understanding and comparing various pay offers. Originally created during a critical period of wage negotiations, this tool reflects our efforts to provide clear, actionable insights into how different proposals stack up against our expectations and needs.

## Background

Several years ago, amidst ongoing negotiations between management and staff, there was a clear need for a straightforward way to visualise the impact of various wage offers. As members of the CPSU, we were committed to not only fighting for fair wages but also ensuring that every staff member could easily understand the implications of the offers presented by management.

This project began as a collaboration between myself and another CPSU union member. Recognising the utility of providing a simple, user-friendly calculator, we set out to create a tool that could break down complex offers into understandable comparisons.

## Development

The initial version of this wage calculator was developed and posted on GitHub by my colleague [here](https://github.com/smypf/wage-calculator). As the negotiation process evolved, so too did the complexity of the management's offers. I forked the initial work to extend its functionality, ensuring that the calculator remained relevant and useful as new data emerged. Over time, I continued to update this tool to reflect the changing landscape of our negotiations.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this calculator is to demystify the numbers and empower our colleagues with the knowledge to make informed decisions. By inputting different wage offers, users can see a direct comparison of how each offer measures up against the union's targets. This tool was instrumental in helping many staff members grasp the nuances of the financial aspects of our negotiations.

## Maintaining the Repository

While the active development phase of this tool has concluded, the repository remains available for historical reference and potential future use. It stands as a testament to the power of collective action and the importance of transparency in negotiations.

We encourage other union members and organizations to adapt this tool for their own needs, continuing the spirit of empowerment and informed decision-making.
